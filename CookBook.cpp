    << "These are the must have ingredients for baking blueberry muffins.\n\n" 
    << "You must gather Fresh or Frozen Blueberries.\n" 
    << "Provided that you posess Frozen Blueberries, put them in while they are still frozen.\n"
    << "Use All-Purpose flour. You can use 100% Whole Wheat flour or a combination of Whole Wheat and All-Purpose flour.\n" 
    << "Using a gluten-free flour blend works although using flour different from All-Purpose will change the muffin's texture. \n"
    << "Granulated Sugar is preferred as it makes the blueberry muffins flavorful and tender. (You can use Brown or Coconut Sugar but be mindful as it will change the bread's texture)\n"
    << "For a more creative taste, add sugar to the muffin tops before baking which changes the muffin top to a crackly top.\n"
    << "Next, you will need oil. You can use butter, but oil makes the muffins more tender.\n"
    << "You also need milk. Homemade Oat, Unsweetened almond, or Coconut Milk works as well.\n"
    << "Eggs brings together the structure and stability to the muffins. But use one egg. (One Flax egg works as well)\n"
    << "You will then need Baking Powder as it is the go-to leavener for Blueberry muffins\n"
    << "Lastly, you will need Salt and Vanilla extract for flavor and taste\n\n"
    << "There are three steps that will be explained in further detail on how to mix the ingredients for Blueberry muffins\n\n"
    << "Step Number One: Whisk 1 1/2 cups of flour, 3/4 cup of sugar, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt in a large bowl.\n"
    << "Step Number Two: Add 1/3 cup of oil, 1 large egg, 1/3 to 1/2 cup milk, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla extract then stir with a fork until blended.\n"
    << "Step Number Three: Mix in 6 to 8 ounces of blueberries, divide the batter between muffin cups and bake.\n\n"
    << "These are directions for how to prepare all other things.\n\n"
    << "Heat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Fill the remaining cups with 1 to 2 tablespoons of water to help the muffins bake evenly.\n"
    << "Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.\n"
    << "Add oil to a measuring jug that holds at least 1 cup. Add the egg then fill the jug to the 1-cup line with milk (1/3 to 1/2 cup milk). Add vanilla and whisk to combine.\n"
    << "Add milk mixture to the bowl with dry ingredients then use a fork to combine. Do not over mix. Fold in the blueberries\n"
    << "Divide the batter between muffin cups. (If making big-topped muffins, the batter will come to the tops of the paper liners). Sprinkle a little sugar on top of each muffin.\n"
    << "Bake muffins 15 to 20 minutes or until tops are no longer wet and a toothpick inserted into the middle of a muffin comes out with crumbs, not wet batter. Transfer to a cooling rack.\n"
    << "To store, place them in a plastic bag, seal, and store at room temperature for 2 to 3 days. To freeze, wrap them tightly in aluminum foil or place them in freezer bags. Freeze for up to 3 months.\n";
