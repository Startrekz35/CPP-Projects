Alright so I'm learning C++ trying to be proficient in this OOP Language to get more of an in depth view of how a machine works. 

I'm actually having a lot of fun dealing with the trial and errors of C++ coding because it teaches me to watch for my mistakes and makes me brainstorm how to get past it

These are ALL my projects and counting showcasing what I've done in C++ thus far
